# BLUE BALLLS
some people say its a myth that blue balls are not there but according to research that has been made by various people it real. According to research by scientists blue balls are caused by sexual arousal  which increases blood flow to the genital area, and if there is no release (ejaculation) a person thends to feel pain in the balls  due engorgement of blood in the genital region, including the testicles. This is not a serious medical condition and generally resolves on its own once sexual arousal decreases or ejaculation occurs. scientifically there is no term that defines this but rather blue balls is just a slang used to refere to this event .The discomfort is often described as a dull ache or heaviness in the testicles as descried by chat GPT. The good news is that after ejaculation this pain is done and you can feel normal again .The moral of the story is that you are supposed to ejaculate but if not you are just supposed to calm down and wait for the for the erection to decrease and the you can gain your senses back. But remember not every pain in the testicles is a blue ball and if it very severe please always seek medical attention to experts.
